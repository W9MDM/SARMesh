# Diagnostics Reference

This document is the authoritative reference for every diagnostic output in Mesh-Client. It covers the two diagnostic subsystems; **Routing** and **RF**; and explains what each finding means, what triggers it, and how to interpret it.

**Where diagnostics appear:**

- **DiagnosticsPanel** (sidebar tab): network health status, anomaly table, halos toggles, environment profile, max-age settings, 24h CU timeline chart
- **NodeDetailModal**: per-node routing health section, redundancy path history, RF findings, MQTT ignore toggle, node notes, watch toggle
- **NodeListPanel**: inline anomaly badges, redundancy `+N` echo count, MQTT-only node dimming, Node Health Score badge, JSON export
- **MapPanel**: channel utilization halos, routing anomaly aura circles
- **RF Histograms panel**: SNR, RSSI, and hop-count bar charts across all nodes
- **Peer Graph panel**: SVG force-directed graph of mesh peers with hop filters — **Meshtastic and MeshCore only**; Reticulum uses the **Topology** tab instead (same 48/400 visible-node cap)

All three protocols share one **Diagnostics** sidebar tab; sections differ by `ProtocolCapabilities` (see **Multi-protocol tab scoping** below).

---

## Multi-protocol tab scoping

`diagnosticsStore.diagnosticRows` is global, but the UI and reanalysis scope rows to the **active protocol tab**:

| Tab            | Anomaly table / health band                                                                | Native audit section                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Meshtastic** | LoRa routing + RF rows only (`reticulum/*` excluded via `filterDiagnosticRowsForProtocol`) | Hidden                               |
| **MeshCore**   | LoRa routing + RF rows only (same filter)                                                  | Hidden                               |
| **Reticulum**  | `reticulum/*` rows only (LoRa hop/CU findings hidden)                                      | `ReticulumDiagnosticsSection` + ping |

**LoRa routing/RF per protocol:** Switching tabs calls `clearDiagnostics({ preserveForeignLora: true })` and `runReanalysis` with that tab's `nodesForUi` and capabilities — Meshtastic anomalies are computed from Meshtastic nodes only; MeshCore from MeshCore contacts only.

**Foreign LoRa overhear UI:** The MeshCore-heard and other-foreign-LoRa tables render on the **Meshtastic** and **MeshCore** LoRa tabs when connected with a known self node id (Meshtastic detections keyed by Meshtastic self id; MeshCore foreign overhear keyed by MeshCore self id). Reticulum RNode foreign overhear is not wired yet (sidecar packet tap exposes RNS-parsed frames only).

**Other surfaces:** `NodeListPanel`, `MapPanel`, and `NodeInfoBody` also call `filterDiagnosticRowsForProtocol` so inline badges and halos match the active tab.

## 1. Network Health Status

The network health band summarizes the current diagnostic state of the mesh in the DiagnosticsPanel header.

| Badge     | Condition                                   | Color  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Healthy   | 0 errors, 0 warnings                        | Green  |
| Attention | Any errors or warnings (routing errors < 3) | Yellow |
| Degraded  | ≥ 3 routing errors                          | Red    |

The panel also shows a breakdown of error and warning counts, and a "This node" line when your connected device has its own issues separate from the mesh-wide picture.

---

## 2. Routing Anomalies

Routing anomaly detection runs on Meshtastic nodes. MeshCore also has `hasHopCount: true` (hops via `outPathLen`), so hop-count-based findings that remain meaningful on MeshCore still run (`impossible_hop`, `route_flapping` / `path_instability`, `weak_link`). Distance-based GPS+hop heuristics (`hop_goblin`, close-in `bad_route` warning) are gated by `hasDistanceBasedHopAnomalies` — **true** for Meshtastic, **false** for MeshCore (nearby multi-hop contacts are poorly connected / repeater-mediated, not Meshtastic-style critical over-hopping). Protocols where `hasHopCount` is `false` (currently Reticulum) skip hop-based LoRa routing anomalies entirely.

Detection is run in priority order; first match wins:

1. `impossible_hop`
2. `bad_route` (error variant — e.g. high duplication)
3. `route_flapping` / `path_instability` (MeshCore: prefers PathUpdated event timestamps when available)
4. `hop_goblin` (Meshtastic only — requires `hasDistanceBasedHopAnomalies`)
5. `weak_link` (MeshCore only, requires `hasPerHopSnr` capability and a completed trace)
6. `bad_route` (warning variant — close-in over-hopping; Meshtastic only — requires `hasDistanceBasedHopAnomalies`)

Routing rows persist for up to **24 hours** by default (configurable 1–168 h in DiagnosticsPanel → Display Settings).

---

### hop_goblin: Error

**Trigger:** A node is within 3 km (standard profile) but is taking more than 2 hops to reach your device.

**Meaning:** A nearby node is routing through intermediate mesh nodes instead of connecting directly. This wastes airtime on rebroadcasts that should not be necessary for a short-range link.

**Environment multipliers:**

| Profile  | Distance threshold | Hop threshold |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Standard | 3 km               | 2 hops        |
| City     | 4.8 km (1.6×)      | 3 hops        |
| Canyon   | 7.8 km (2.6×)      | 4 hops        |

If your GPS source is IP-geolocation (low accuracy), the distance threshold is doubled automatically and a yellow banner appears in the diagnostics panel.

**MQTT behavior:** Skipped entirely for MQTT-only nodes (`heard_via_mqtt_only`). For hybrid nodes (heard via both RF and MQTT), the anomaly still fires but a yellow advisory note suggests enabling MQTT filtering as a first diagnostic step before adjusting node placement.

---

### bad_route: Two Variants

**Error variant (duplication rate):**

- **Trigger:** More than 55% of a node's recent packets are duplicates.
- **Meaning:** The mesh is forwarding the same packet through multiple competing paths from this node. This typically indicates a routing loop or excessive redundant rebroadcasting.

**Warning variant (close-in over-hopping):**

- **Trigger:** A node within 5 miles is taking more than `hopThreshold + 2` hops.
- **Meaning:** Suboptimal path; the node is reachable but the route is longer than expected for its distance.

---

### impossible_hop: Error

**Trigger:** A node reports 0 hops (direct neighbor) but is more than 100 miles away (GPS coordinates required on both your device and the remote node).

**Meaning:** Either the GPS coordinates are stale or wrong, or the hop-count metadata is unreliable for this node. The node's position data should be treated with suspicion.

**Note:** Skipped for protocols without `hasHopCount` capability (currently Reticulum only — MeshCore has `hasHopCount: true` and is subject to this check).

---

### route_flapping: Warning

**Trigger:** The hop count to a node changes more than 3 times within the last 10 minutes.

**Meaning:** The node's path through the mesh is unstable. Common causes include competing routes of similar quality, marginal RF links where the best next-hop changes frequently, or a node that is on the edge of coverage.

**MeshCore variant (path_instability):** When PathUpdated (0x81) events are available, the engine counts actual path-change events in the last 10 minutes instead of hop-count transitions. Same trigger threshold (> 3 changes) and same `route_flapping` anomaly type.

---

### weak_link: Warning (MeshCore only)

**Trigger:** A completed MeshCore trace (`tracePath`) with per-hop SNR data (`hasPerHopSnr`) shows at least one hop with SNR below −5 dB.

**Meaning:** There is a weak relay in the traced path. The hop number and SNR are reported. The link may degrade further under noise or when the node moves.

**Confidence:** `proven` (requires observed trace data, not a heuristic).

---

## 3. RF Diagnostics

RF diagnostics analyze signal-layer data from radio telemetry. There are two categories: **Connected Node** (your directly attached device, using LocalStats telemetry) and **Remote Nodes** (other mesh nodes, observed from their telemetry packets).

RF rows expire after **1 hour** (fixed, not configurable).

---

### Connected Node Findings

These findings use LocalStats data from your own device's radio.

| Finding                        | Trigger                                                                                    | Severity | Meaning                                                                                                                                                  |

| Hidden Terminal Risk           | CU > 40%, bad rate 5–10%, no industrial finding                                            | Warning  | Multiple transmitters cannot hear each other and are colliding at your node; a classic hidden terminal scenario                                          |
| LoRa Collision or Corruption   | Bad packet rate > 10% (catch-all)                                                          | Warning  | Preamble decoded but CRC/decode failed; often caused by non-Meshtastic LoRa devices on the same frequency                                                |

---

### Remote Node Findings

These findings use telemetry observed from other nodes' radio stats.

| Finding                   | Trigger                                                               | Severity | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| External Interference     | CU > 25% and air TX < 5%                                              | Warning  | Same pattern as connected node finding, observed at a remote node  |
| Channel Utilization Spike | Same gates as connected node (rolling average, min samples, cooldown) | Warning  | Sudden congestion at a remote node's location                      |
| Wideband Noise Floor      | CU > 25%, SNR < 0 dB                                                  | Warning  | Last-hop SNR only; elevated noise floor at the remote node         |
| Fringe / Weak Coverage    | CU ≤ 10%, SNR < 0 dB                                                  | Info     | Node is at the edge of mesh coverage; low activity and poor signal |

### MeshCore-Only RF Findings (Connected Node)

These findings use packet-stats data from a MeshCore device's Repeater Status response (`meshcore_local_stats`).

| Finding                 | Trigger                                                                        | Severity        | Meaning                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elevated Noise Floor    | Radio noise floor > −95 dBm                                                    | Warning         | Elevated interference from nearby RF sources reducing effective range                         |
| Excessive Flooding      | ≥ 20 total transmissions and > 90% are flood-routed (`nSentFlood / totalSent`) | Warning         | Direct routing has not been established with nearby nodes; all traffic falls back to flooding |
| High Companion TX Queue | `meshcore_local_stats.queueLen > 200` (error if `> 250`)                       | Warning / Error | Companion outbound queue near the 256 cap; traffic may be delayed or dropped                  |

---

## 4. Foreign LoRa Detection

Foreign LoRa detection identifies **cross-protocol / unrecognized** LoRa traffic observed by your connected device's radio (Meshtastic hearing MeshCore or unknown LoRa; MeshCore hearing Meshtastic / unknown LoRa; dual-radio setups can also bridge MeshCore RX into the Meshtastic listener map). The detection window is the **last 90 minutes**.

**Diagnostics UI:** Foreign-LoRa tables appear on the **Meshtastic** and **MeshCore** protocol tabs (see **Multi-protocol tab scoping**).

**Signal classes:**

| Class          | Label               | Severity |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `meshcore`     | MeshCore Activity   | Info     |
| `meshtastic`   | Meshtastic Traffic  | Info     |
| `reticulum`    | Reticulum Traffic   | Info     |
| `unknown-lora` | Unknown LoRa Signal | Info     |

`reticulum` is detected when a Meshtastic radio logs a decode failure whose hex dump matches the [Reticulum RNS wire format](https://reticulum.network/manual/understanding.html) (HEADER_1 / HEADER_2). This indicates a nearby RNode or other Reticulum LoRa node on the same band — not traffic your Meshtastic node can decode.

**Ingress paths:**

| Source                     | When recorded                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meshtastic firmware logs   | Decode-failure / CRC lines with RSSI/SNR (`applyMeshtasticForeignLoraFromLog`)                                                                                |
| MeshCore RF RX (event 136) | Dual-radio: MeshCore heard on Meshtastic listener node; also foreign `meshtastic` / `reticulum` / `unknown-lora` when on MeshCore tab and `raw` bytes present |

**Not implemented:** RNode promiscuous foreign-LoRa from the Reticulum sidecar (packet tap delivers RNS-parsed frames only).

**Proximity classification** (from RSSI/SNR):

- Very Close
- Nearby
- Distant
- Unknown Distance

**Escalation:** If MeshCore packets exceed 5 per minute, the finding upgrades to **Potential MeshCore Repeater Conflict** (Warning); indicating a nearby MeshCore repeater that may be competing for airtime on the same frequency.

**Cooldown:** The same (nodeId, class) pair updates at most every 5 minutes to avoid flooding the table.

---

## 5. Packet Redundancy

Packet redundancy measures how many distinct paths each packet travels through the mesh; both RF paths and MQTT. A higher redundancy score means a node is reachable via multiple independent routes, which improves reliability.

**Where it appears:**

- NodeListPanel "Redund." column (sortable)
- NodeDetailModal "Connection Health %" row + collapsible "Path History" in the Routing Health section

**Tracking:** The last 20 packets per node are tracked. For each packet, the number of distinct observed paths (RF + MQTT) is recorded.

**Score formula:**

```
score = min(round((maxPaths - 1) / 3 × 100), 100)
```

| maxPaths | Score | Meaning              |
| -------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| 1        | 0%    | Single path only     |
| 2        | 33%   | One echo             |
| 3        | 67%   | Two echoes           |
| 4+       | 100%  | Three or more echoes |

**Display:**

- `+N` echoes where N = maxPaths − 1
- ≥ 3 echoes: lime green (excellent redundancy)
- 1–2 echoes: gray
- 0 echoes: muted dash

**Cache:** 15-minute TTL per packet, maximum 2000 entries before cleanup.

---

## 6. Map Visualizations

### Channel Utilization Halos

Toggle: **"Show channel utilization halos on map"** in DiagnosticsPanel.

Halos appear as colored circles around node positions, sized relative to channel utilization.

| CU range | Color  |
| -------- | ------ |
| < 15%    | Green  |
| 15–30%   | Yellow |
| 31–50%   | Orange |
| ≥ 51%    | Red    |

**Radius:** `(CU / 100) × 14` pixels.

### Routing Anomaly Halos

Toggle: **"Show routing anomaly halos on map"** in DiagnosticsPanel.

| Severity | Style               | Radius | Animation         |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Error    | Red dashed circle   | 500m   | Fast pulse (1.4s) |
| Warning  | Amber dashed circle | 500m   | Slow pulse (2s)   |
| Info     | Blue thin circle    | 350m   | None              |

---

## 7. MQTT Filtering

### Global Ignore MQTT

Checkbox in DiagnosticsPanel settings.

When enabled:

- MQTT-only nodes are dimmed in NodeListPanel (`opacity-50`, strikethrough on name/short name)
- `bad_route` duplication-rate checks are skipped for MQTT-only nodes (and per-node ignored IDs)
- All nodes are re-analyzed immediately

Hop-based routing anomalies (`impossible_hop`, `hop_goblin`, close-in `bad_route`, `route_flapping`) are **always** skipped for MQTT-only nodes — no toggle required. On MQTT, `hops_away === 0` means direct to the MQTT bridge, not RF-direct to you.

### Per-Node MQTT Ignore

Toggle in NodeDetailModal ("MQTT Ignore" row); pill button in the anomaly table Action column.

- Same duplication skip as global ignore, scoped to one node
- Persisted to `localStorage['mesh-client:mqttIgnoredNodes']`
- Active nodes shown as yellow badge in DiagnosticsPanel "Per-Node MQTT Filters" section
- Active nodes show a yellow "MQTT Ignored" badge in the NodeDetailModal header

### Hybrid Nodes

A hybrid node has been heard via both RF and MQTT in the current session. For hybrid nodes, `hop_goblin` still fires (unlike MQTT-only nodes) but adds a yellow advisory note suggesting per-node MQTT filtering as a first diagnostic step before adjusting node placement.

---

## 8. Environment Profiles

The environment profile adjusts detection thresholds to account for different RF propagation environments.

Selected in DiagnosticsPanel settings via a segmented control.

| Profile  | Distance multiplier | Hop threshold | Use when                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard | 1×                  | 2 hops        | Rural / open terrain                                     |
| City     | 1.6×                | 3 hops        | Dense urban environment with buildings blocking RF       |
| Canyon   | 2.6×                | 4 hops        | Mountainous or canyon terrain with significant multipath |

**Low-accuracy GPS:** When your position is derived from IP geolocation (city-level only), distance thresholds are doubled automatically in addition to any profile multiplier. A yellow banner appears in the diagnostics panel indicating reduced accuracy.

---

## 9. Node Status Thresholds

| Status  | Condition                             | Color  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Online  | Last heard < 2 hours                  | Green  |
| Stale   | Last heard 2–72 hours                 | Yellow |
| Offline | Last heard ≥ 72 hours, or never heard | Gray   |

**SNR quality** (used in path traces and neighbor SNR bars):

| SNR    | Quality  | Color  |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| ≥ 5 dB | Good     | Green  |
| 0–4 dB | Marginal | Yellow |
| < 0 dB | Poor     | Red    |

---

## 10. Node Health Score

A composite 0–100 score shown as a color-coded badge on each node row in NodeListPanel.

**Sub-scores:**

| Sub-score | Max pts | Source                                            |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Signal    | 40      | SNR normalized over −20 to +20 dB range           |
| Recency   | 30      | 30 if heard < 1 h, 15 if < 6 h, 0 otherwise       |
| Load      | 20      | Channel utilization inverted (`20 − CU/100 × 20`) |
| Battery   | 10      | Battery % / 10; omitted (0) when unavailable      |

**Tiers:**

| Score | Tier | Badge color |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| ≥ 70  | Good | Green       |
| 40–69 | Warn | Yellow      |
| < 40  | Poor | Red         |

The tooltip breakdown shows each sub-score and the total. Works for both Meshtastic and MeshCore.

---

## 11. Node Notes

Free-text notes attached to a node, editable in NodeDetailModal.

- Persisted in the `node_notes` SQLite table (schema v31) keyed by `node_id`
- Saves are debounced 500 ms during typing; a final flush fires on modal close
- IPC handlers: `db:getNodeNote` (read on modal open), `db:setNodeNote` (write)

---

## 12. Watch / Notify

Watch a node to receive OS desktop notifications when its online status changes.

- Toggle the watch state from NodeDetailModal (bell icon button)
- Watched node IDs are persisted in `localStorage['mesh-client:watchedNodes']` as a JSON array
- **Online notification**: fires when a watched node transitions from non-online → online
- **Offline notification**: fires when a watched node transitions from online → non-online; includes last-heard time
- The first render after a node is added to the watch list establishes the baseline; no notification fires until the next actual transition

---

## 13. Channel Utilization History Chart

A 24-hour CU timeline chart in DiagnosticsPanel showing the connected node's channel utilization over time.

- Only rendered for the connected node (LocalStats data required)
- At least 2 time-stamped samples are needed before the chart appears
- Line chart (Recharts `LineChart`) with time on the X-axis and CU% on the Y-axis

---

## 14. RF Histograms Panel

Accessible via the RF icon in the sidebar.

Three bar charts built from live node data across both protocols:

- **SNR histogram**: distribution of last-heard SNR values in 5 dB buckets
- **RSSI histogram**: distribution of last-heard RSSI values in 10 dBm buckets
- **Hop count histogram**: distribution of `hops_away` values (0–5+)

Data is read directly from the node store; no additional telemetry required.

## 15. Peer Graph Panel

Accessible via the graph icon in the sidebar.

SVG force-directed graph of Meshtastic and MeshCore peers (Reticulum uses the **Topology** tab with the same hop controls and visible-node cap).

- **Show distant peers** (Peer Graph default **off**; Topology default **on**) and **Max hops** (Peer Graph default **2**; Topology default **All hops**) filter the node set first. Numeric **Max hops** is applied even when Show distant is off. Unknown hops are omitted unless Max hops is **All hops** and Show distant is on. The nearby hop ceiling (Mesh hops > 1, Reticulum hops > 2) applies only when Max hops is **All hops**. 1-hop Mesh nodes are not distant.
- Layout budget (known limitation): at most **400** nodes after hop filters (`FORCE_REPULSION_FULL_PAIR_CAP`). The toolbar states this limit; when the cap hides nodes the status reads “limit 400”
- Both Meshtastic and MeshCore use the `hops_away` field for edge inference
- Nodes are clickable; clicking opens NodeDetailModal for that node
- Layout uses D3-style force simulation; positions stabilize after initial render

## 16. Reticulum interface config diagnostics

On the **Reticulum** protocol tab, the **Diagnostics** panel includes a **Reticulum interface config** section (below continuous ping). It audits the sidecar rnsd config against the live RNS interface list and surfaces actionable repairs.

Runtime interface-issue rows from the sidecar latch (`interfaceIssueAlert`) are also folded into Diagnostics via `ReticulumDiagnosticEngine` — including TCP connect failures, TX queue drops (generic / **`txQueueDropsBle`** / **`txQueueDropsBleBondStale`** / **`txQueueDropsBleFlowControl`** when the drop interface is a BLE RNode — bond-stale wins over flow-control congestion; FC BLE drops are **warning** with no repair action), link-delivery timeouts, transport saturation, **`bleBondRemoved`** (stale OS Bluetooth bond for an RNode; Forget/Clear paired/re-pair — sticky until stack stop), and **`blePairingTimedOut`** (OS passkey not entered within the TX-read window). Live host TX fill (before drops) is shown in the main-header **Q** badge / amber buffering spinner (worst local-RF fill), separate from these post-drop Diagnostics rows.

Additional runtime rows (refreshed from sidecar status + `reticulumPropagationStore`, not only the config audit poll):

Announce-bus pressure attribution: when a single interface owns ≥50% of recent `peers_updated` path samples (min 20 in 5 min), Diagnostics names that **hot interface**. Enabled `boundary`-mode hubs (or default-preset hubs) and any `txQueueDrops` interface names are listed in tips. Path/peer tables stay in memory; announce storms mainly threatened batched identity-activity SQLite writes, which are gated under pressure.

The Connection tab **Interfaces** list shows the same audit hints per row (amber/red subtext) with **Repair** / **Turn off Share instance** / **Disable** shortcuts. **SharedInstanceServer** / **SharedInstanceClient** are runtime-only — they show a **Runtime** badge and cannot be edited or deleted from config. In **SharedInstanceClient** mode, misleading `tcp_unreachable` / ghost-TCP alerts for this app’s hubs are suppressed. The `runtime_only_interface` audit note is intentionally omitted from the Diagnostics panel (expected state, not a fault); misconfiguration is reported via `missing_shared_instance`, `shared_instance_client`, or `shared_instance_unexpected` instead.

## 18. Technical Reference

This section documents the exact protocol and hardware mechanisms behind each diagnostic finding. Thresholds are quoted directly from the source code.

### 18.1 RF Findings: Connected Node

#### Utilization vs. TX

**Trigger:** `channel_utilization > 25%` (`HIGH_CU`) and `air_util_tx < 5%` (`LOW_TX`)

**Mechanism:** Meshtastic uses CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance). Before transmitting, the LoRa radio performs a Channel Activity Detection (CAD) check. `channel_utilization` counts the fraction of time the radio detected any RF energy on the channel; including non-decodable signals. `air_util_tx` counts only the time _your_ radio was actually transmitting. When CU is high but TX is very low, the radio is repeatedly sensing a busy channel and backing off; it cannot transmit because it keeps losing the CAD check.

**Fields:** `channel_utilization` (% of time channel was active in the last stats window, delivered via `NodeInfo.DeviceMetrics`); `air_util_tx` (% of the same window your node was actually on air).

**Common sources:** Co-located high-power transmitters (other LoRa gateways or repeaters on the same channel); local mesh congestion from nodes with high hop limits flooding the channel; or a non-LoRa wideband signal raising the energy floor.

**Mitigation:** Reduce hop limits on nearby high-traffic nodes; relocate antenna away from co-located transmitters; switch to a less-congested frequency plan.

---

#### Non-LoRa Noise / RFI

**Trigger:** `channel_utilization > 25%`, `num_packets_rx >= 5` (`MIN_SAMPLE`), and `num_packets_rx_bad === 0`

**Mechanism:** The LoRa radio's CAD/energy-detect circuit triggers on any RF energy above threshold (~−120 dBm), raising `channel_utilization`. But non-LoRa signals do not carry a valid LoRa preamble/sync word. When the radio detects energy without a valid preamble it does not even attempt demodulation, so `num_packets_rx_bad` stays at 0. The zero bad-packet criterion is what distinguishes wideband RFI from LoRa interference: real LoRa signals (even from foreign networks) produce demodulation attempts and CRC failures; pure noise or non-LoRa wideband sources do not.

**Fields:** `num_packets_rx_bad` must be exactly 0; `num_packets_rx` must be ≥ 5 to ensure the sample size is meaningful.

**Common sources:** DC motor brushes and variable-frequency drives (900 MHz harmonics); switching-mode power supplies; other ISM-band devices operating in continuous-wave mode (older cordless phones, some baby monitors).

**Mitigation:** Identify the noise source with a spectrum analyzer or SDR. Physically separate the antenna from nearby electronics. A bandpass or SAW filter on the antenna feed can attenuate out-of-band energy before it reaches the LoRa front end.

---

#### 900 MHz Industrial Interference

**Trigger:** `num_packets_rx_bad / num_packets_rx > 20%` (`SPIKE_BAD_RATE`) and `channel_utilization > 25%`

**Mechanism:** 900 MHz ISM-band industrial devices; smart meters, SCADA telemetry, agricultural sensors; typically use FSK or GFSK modulation. The LoRa radio's CAD circuit detects their energy (raising CU) and in many cases detects what resembles a LoRa preamble, triggering a full demodulation attempt that fails CRC because the modulation is incompatible. The result is a high `num_packets_rx_bad / num_packets_rx` ratio alongside elevated CU. The >20% bad-rate threshold (higher than the 5–10% Hidden Terminal band) reflects the bursty, high-power nature of industrial transmitters.

**Fields:** `num_packets_rx_bad`, `num_packets_rx`, `channel_utilization`; all reported in `DeviceMetrics` / LocalStats telemetry packets.

**Common sources:** AMI smart meters (e.g., Itron, Landis+Gyr, Sensus operating on 902–928 MHz); agricultural IoT networks; oil/gas pipeline SCADA systems; municipal water metering.

**Mitigation:** Channel-hop to a less-contested sub-band (if your region and firmware support it); install a cavity or bandpass filter for the specific Meshtastic channel frequency. For permanent base-station installs in dense smart-meter areas, a SAW filter is often required.

---

#### Channel Utilization Spike

**Trigger:** Current `channel_utilization > 2×` 30-minute rolling average, with gates: ≥ 12 samples, ≥ 30-minute span, rolling average ≥ 1%. 15-minute cooldown per node before re-firing.

**Mechanism:** The detector maintains a rolling 24-hour history of `channel_utilization` samples in `diagnosticsStore.cuHistory` (entries from LocalStats / device-metrics telemetry and NodeInfo updates via `processNodeUpdate`). `computeCuStats24h` computes the rolling average over the pruned sample window. A spike fires when current CU exceeds 2× that baseline. The 15-minute cooldown (`cuSpikeLastFired` map in `RFDiagnosticEngine`) prevents the same node from re-firing while CU remains elevated. Cooldown state is cleared by `clearDiagnostics()`.

**Fields:** Current `channel_utilization` vs. stored per-node `CuSample[]` history in diagnosticsStore.

**Common sources:** Sudden network event (new repeater powered on, MQTT downlink storm, firmware retransmission loop); external interference source that just came online; a scheduled transmitter on a recurring duty cycle.

**Mitigation:** Determine whether the spike is sustained or transient. If sustained, treat as mesh congestion or external interference. If it correlates with a time pattern, a scheduled transmitter may be nearby.

---

#### Mesh Congestion

**Trigger:** `num_rx_dupe / num_packets_rx > 15%` (`HIGH_DUPE_RATE`)

**Mechanism:** The Meshtastic firmware maintains a duplicate-detection window keyed by packet ID. When a node receives a packet it has already processed, it increments `num_rx_dupe` without rebroadcasting. A high duplicate rate means many nodes are re-forwarding the same packets; typically caused by too many nodes having high hop limits, causing the mesh to flood rather than route. The client-side `recordDuplicate()` in diagnosticsStore also feeds this counter from MQTT-observed duplicates.

**Fields:** `num_rx_dupe`, `num_packets_rx` from `DeviceMetrics`.

**Common sources:** Too many routers/repeaters in a dense mesh with default hop limits; MQTT-RF loop where the same packet arrives via both RF and the MQTT broker; overlapping repeater coverage with no intelligent routing.

**Mitigation:** Reduce hop limits on nearby routers (3 is often sufficient for most networks); enable the MQTT duplicate-ignore feature for bridged nodes; review `ROUTER` vs. `CLIENT_MUTE` roles to reduce unnecessary rebroadcasting.

---

#### Hidden Terminal Risk

**Trigger:** `channel_utilization > 40%` (`HIDDEN_TERMINAL_CU`), bad packet rate in the range 5–10% (`HIDDEN_TERMINAL_BAD_MIN` / `HIGH_BAD_RATE`), and the Industrial finding is not already present.

**Mechanism:** The "hidden terminal" problem occurs when two transmitters (A and C) are both within range of your node (B) but cannot hear each other. Both use CSMA and check the channel before transmitting; but since they cannot detect each other's transmissions, both conclude the channel is clear simultaneously and transmit at the same time. Your node receives both overlapping signals, causing a collision: the LoRa preamble is detected (so demodulation is attempted) but the combined signal fails CRC. The 5–10% bad-rate band is specific to this scenario: below 5% is noise floor, above 10% is caught by the general LoRa Collision finding (or Industrial if >20%). The Industrial finding is evaluated first; if present, it blocks this finding.

**Fields:** `channel_utilization`, `num_packets_rx_bad`, `num_packets_rx`.

**Common sources:** Dense deployments where many nodes are at the edge of range to a central gateway; hilltop gateway nodes receiving from many edge nodes that cannot hear each other; hub-and-spoke repeater topologies.

**Mitigation:** Use directional antennas to reduce the number of simultaneous transmitters in view; reduce hop limits to limit the number of nodes routing through this node; consider splitting into multiple channels.

---

#### LoRa Collision or Corruption

**Trigger:** `num_packets_rx_bad / num_packets_rx > 10%` (`HIGH_BAD_RATE`), catch-all when the Industrial finding is not present.

**Mechanism:** The LoRa radio decoded a valid-looking preamble/sync word but the payload CRC failed. This indicates the packet was either corrupted in flight (multipath, near-far problem) or was transmitted by a non-Meshtastic LoRa network using the same frequency and spreading factor but a different sync word or modulation depth. Unlike the Non-LoRa RFI finding (which never produces demodulation attempts), this finding requires that the radio actually tried to decode the packet.

**Fields:** `num_packets_rx_bad / num_packets_rx`.

**Common sources:** LoRaWAN networks operating on the same channel (common in the 902–928 MHz US ISM band); other Meshtastic networks on the same channel with different PSKs; near-far collisions where a strong nearby transmitter overwhelms a weaker distant packet mid-reception.

**Mitigation:** Channel planning to avoid LoRaWAN frequencies; directional antenna with a bandpass filter; coordinate frequency and spreading-factor usage with operators of co-located LoRa deployments.

### 18.2 RF Findings: Remote Nodes

SNR-based findings (`Wideband Noise Floor`, `Fringe`) are only emitted when `snrMeaningfulForNodeDiagnostics` returns `true`; which requires that the remote node is a 0-hop direct RF neighbor, ensuring the SNR value reflects the actual link to your node rather than a multi-hop path.

---

#### External Interference

**Trigger:** `channel_utilization > 25%` and `air_util_tx < 5%` on a remote node.

**Mechanism:** Same CSMA backoff pattern as the connected-node "Utilization vs. TX" finding, but observed on a remote node via its `DeviceMetrics` telemetry. The remote node's radio is sensing a busy channel and reducing its own transmissions.

**Telemetry path:** The remote node reports `channel_utilization` and `air_util_tx` in its `NodeInfo` packet; your connected device receives this and forwards it to the app via the mesh. Because this is a remote observation, causes are specific to that node's physical location, not your environment.

---

#### Wideband Noise Floor

**Trigger:** `channel_utilization > 25%` and `SNR < 0 dB` (0-hop RF neighbor only).

**Mechanism:** Elevated CU combined with a negative SNR on the last hop indicates that the remote node's location has an elevated RF noise floor. SNR in Meshtastic is the ratio of the received signal power to the noise floor at the _receiver_; a negative value means the noise floor is higher than the signal (the packet still decoded because LoRa spread-spectrum can operate below the noise floor). This combination implies that even though many transmissions are detected, signal quality is degraded by broadband noise at that location.

**Fields:** `snr` from the most recent packet received from this node (last-hop only, 0-hop RF).

**Common sources:** Faulty electronics in the same structure as the node; proximity to power lines with corona discharge; poorly shielded switching supplies near the antenna.

---

#### Fringe / Weak Coverage

**Trigger:** `channel_utilization ≤ 10%` and `SNR < 0 dB` (0-hop RF neighbor only).

**Mechanism:** Low CU means the node is not hearing much mesh traffic; it is on the periphery of coverage or in an RF shadow. The negative SNR confirms the link quality is marginal. This is informational: the node is functional but poorly connected to the rest of the mesh.

**Note:** Because severity is `info`, this finding does not contribute to the error or warning counts in the health status band.

### 18.3 Routing Anomalies

#### hop_goblin (`RoutingDiagnosticEngine.detectHopGoblin()`)

**What it measures:** The `hops_away` field from the received NodeInfo packet vs. the haversine distance between your connected node's GPS coordinates and the remote node's GPS coordinates. `hops_away` is the hop count embedded in the Meshtastic packet header by the originating firmware; it is decremented by each relay node and thus reflects how many RF hops the packet actually traversed.

**Distance computation:** Uses `haversineDistanceKm()` from `nodeStatus.ts`; a standard great-circle distance formula. Requires that both your connected node and the remote node have valid non-null GPS coordinates in their NodeInfo.

**Why GPS is required:** Earlier implementations used SNR + hops heuristics, but `rxSnr` is last-hop only (meaningless for multi-hop originators and MQTT-only nodes). GPS distance is the only reliable proxy for expected hop count.

**Note on `distanceOffsetKm`:** User-adjustable in Diagnostics (0–50 km, step 0.5; persisted in `app_settings`). It raises the GPS-distance floor used by hop-goblin / bad-route thresholds and complements the environment profile’s `distanceMultiplier`. Default is `0` (no extra baseline).

---

#### bad_route (`RoutingDiagnosticEngine.detectBadRoute()`)

**Duplicate tracking:** `diagnosticsStore.packetStats` accumulates `{ total, duplicates }` per originating node. `total` is incremented on every `processNodeUpdate` call for that node; `duplicates` is incremented by `recordDuplicate()`, which is called from the Meshtastic runtime MQTT dedup handler (`runtime/useMeshtasticRuntime.ts`). The ratio `duplicates / total` is evaluated against the 55% threshold.

**Close-in over-hopping:** Uses the same haversine distance as hop_goblin but converted to miles (1 km = 0.621371 mi); threshold is 5 miles × profile multiplier. The hop threshold used here is `hopsThreshold + 2`; for Standard profile that is 4, City 5, Canyon 6.

**Why 55% for routing loop:** At 55%+ duplication, the packet is arriving from multiple mesh paths more often than not, indicating the routing algorithm is forwarding it redundantly; characteristic of a routing loop or an over-configured flood mesh.

---

#### impossible_hop (`RoutingDiagnosticEngine.detectImpossibleHop()`)

**The 0-hop case:** `hops_away === 0` means the originating firmware stamped this packet as a direct transmission (no relays). In a legitimate direct link, 0 hops is only possible within LoRa range (typically ≤ ~20 km under ideal conditions). The 100-mile (~160 km) threshold is deliberately conservative to avoid false positives.

**Why this happens:** On MQTT, `hops_away` is derived from packet `hopStart - hopLimit`; when equal, the bridge reports 0 hops (heard directly by the gateway). That is not comparable to RF distance to your device. MQTT-only nodes are excluded via `hopCountMeaningfulForNodeDiagnostics()`. Can also indicate stale GPS on RF-heard nodes where a node moved but has not updated its position.

**Capability skip:** `capabilities?.hasHopCount === false` causes this check to be bypassed entirely. MeshCore's capability is `true` (hops via `outPathLen`), so this only skips for Reticulum today.

---

#### route_flapping (`RoutingDiagnosticEngine.detectRouteFlapping()`)

**Hop history:** `diagnosticsStore.hopHistory` stores `{ t: timestamp, h: hops_away }` tuples per node, pruned to a 24-hour window. The flapping detector filters to the last 10 minutes and counts transitions where `recent[i].h !== recent[i-1].h`. More than 3 transitions fires the warning.

**What this looks like:** A node whose hop count alternates between 2 and 3 on successive packets over 10 minutes has `changes = 6` → fires. A node that was 3 hops and settled to 2 hops has `changes = 1` → does not fire.

**Common causes:** Two relay paths of similar quality competing; a relay node that is intermittently reachable (marginal RF link); environmental RF changes (vehicles, weather, multipath) altering which relay wins the forwarding race.

---

### 18.4 Foreign LoRa Detection

#### Packet classification

**General path** (`foreignLoraDetection.classifyPayload()`): operates on raw LoRa payload bytes (MeshCore RF RX, packet log):

| Order | Rule                                                            | Classification |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1     | `parseMeshCoreRfPacket(raw).ok`                                 | `meshcore`     |
| 2     | `raw[0] === 0x3c`                                               | `meshcore`     |
| 3     | Meshtastic dest/sender ID + hop flags (see below)               | `meshtastic`   |
| 4     | `looksLikeReticulumPayload(raw)` (RNS HEADER_1/2, 19–500 bytes) | `reticulum`    |
| 5     | Fallback                                                        | `unknown-lora` |

**Meshtastic decode-fail overhear** (`classifyMeshtasticForeignOverhear()`): used when Meshtastic firmware already rejected the frame. Checks `0x3c` → MeshCore, then Reticulum structure **before** the permissive MeshCore parser, then falls back to `classifyPayload()`.

Meshtastic short/full header rules (unchanged):

| Rule                    | Byte condition                                                                                                                                        | Classification |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Meshtastic short packet | `raw.length` 8–15 AND bytes 0–3 = valid destId AND bytes 4–7 = valid senderId (both non-zero, non-broadcast `0xFFFFFFFF`)                             | `meshtastic`   |
| Meshtastic full header  | `raw.length >= 16` AND bytes 0–3 = valid destId AND bytes 4–7 = valid senderId AND byte 12 flags: `hop_limit` (bits [2:0]) ≤ `hop_start` (bits [7:5]) | `meshtastic`   |

#### Connected-node telemetry ingest (Meshtastic)

`meshtasticNodeSideEffects` feeds **LocalStats** into `diagnosticsStore.processNodeUpdate` (CU history / connected-node RF analysis). `meshtasticRawPacketSideEffects` feeds RF mesh packets that update `hops_away`/SNR so hop history and incremental RF analysis stay live. (Previously only device-metrics / NodeInfo paths — and briefly `meshtasticRuntimeWireEffects` — fed the store.) Guarded by `meshtasticRuntimeWireEffects.diagnostics.contract.test.ts`.

#### Proximity classification (`classifyProximity()`)

RSSI is the primary signal; SNR is used as fallback when RSSI is unavailable.

| RSSI              | SNR (fallback)    | Label            |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| > −80 dBm         | > 8 dB            | Very Close       |
| −95 to −80 dBm    | 2–8 dB            | Nearby           |
| < −95 dBm         | < 2 dB            | Distant          |
| neither available | neither available | Unknown Distance |

**MeshCore log-pattern detection** (`containsMeshCorePattern()`): Device log messages mentioning decode failures and containing `0x3c` (or `<`) are matched via regex; this catches MeshCore traffic even when only the log stream is available (no raw packet data).

#### MeshCore rate escalation

A module-level `RollingRateCounter(60_000)` counts MeshCore-class packets in the last 60 seconds. When `getRate() > 5` (more than 5 packets/minute), the diagnostic row is promoted from Info to Warning with the label "Potential MeshCore Repeater Conflict." This threshold targets active repeater behavior; a repeater forwards many packets per minute; vs. an occasional passthrough.

#### 5-minute cooldown

`rfRowCooldowns: Map<string, number>` is keyed by `"nodeId:packetClass"`. The same sender/class combination updates at most once every 5 minutes, preventing table noise during sustained interference events.

---

### 18.5 Packet Redundancy

#### Data model

Each incoming packet (RF or MQTT) calls `recordPacketPath(packetId, fromNodeId, path)` in diagnosticsStore. Packets with `packetId === 0` are rejected (protobuf default / missing field). Each record stores an array of `PacketPath` objects: `{ transport: 'rf' | 'mqtt', snr?, rssi?, timestamp }`.

#### The `maxPaths` metric

For each `PacketRecord`, `paths.length` is the number of times that specific packet arrived via distinct observed paths. `maxPaths` is the maximum `paths.length` across the last 20 packets for a given node; the highest observed redundancy under current conditions.

**Why max, not average:** A single highly-redundant packet proves the mesh _can_ deliver multiple paths to this node. The max represents the theoretical ceiling under current conditions; an average would be pulled down by single-path packets during quiet periods.

#### Cache management

15-minute TTL per `PacketRecord` (keyed by `packetId`). When the cache exceeds 2000 entries, all entries older than 15 minutes are pruned. The packetCache is session-only and is not persisted to disk.
