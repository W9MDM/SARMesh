## Authors

**[Joey (NV0N)](https://github.com/rinchen)** created the original [Meshtastic Mac Client](https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/meshtastic_mac_client): a Python/PyQt6 desktop app for macOS. Driven by the lack of native, BLE-capable options for macOS, Joey initially shared the tool with the Colorado Meshtastic community. As interest grew, he matured the app by integrating MeshCore and Reticulum support to meet expanding user needs.

**[dude.eth](https://github.com/defidude)** ported the concept to Electron, enabling cross-platform support across Mac, Linux, and Windows.
