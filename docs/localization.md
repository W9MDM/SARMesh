## Contributing Translations

Most translations in Mesh-Client are initially machine-generated using [MyMemory](https://mymemory.translated.net/). We rely on community contributions to improve translation quality and accuracy.

### Reporting an Error

If you find a mistranslation or an awkward phrasing:

1. Go to the [Mesh-Client Issues](https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/mesh-client/issues) page.
2. Open a new [Translation Error](https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/mesh-client/issues/new?assignees=&labels=translation&template=translation-error.md&title=Translation+Error) issue.
3. Provide the current text and your suggested correction.

CI does **not** run `check:i18n` as a standalone workflow step. Quality rules run via **pre-commit** (`pnpm run check:i18n`) and indirectly in CI through Vitest (`locale-quality.test.ts` subprocess). See [docs/agents/i18n.md](agents/i18n.md) for maintainer commands (`pnpm run check:i18n`, `pnpm run i18n:auto-translate`).

### Quality checks (selected categories)

`scripts/check-i18n-quality.mjs` enforces more than missing keys. Notable rule families:

- **Boot sequence** (`bootSequence.transport*`, `bootSequence.radioInterfaceFallback`) — short transport labels must not be mistranslated as serial numbers, TV series, broadcast stations, or mixed-language RF interface text.
- **Reticulum hub/stack** (`connectionPanel.reticulumInterfaces.*`, `reticulumStack*`, `reticulumPeers.*`) — “hub”, “stack”, “peer”, and “host” must not become unrelated words (pressure, colleague, chimney stack, etc.).
- **TX/RX Texas** — radio `TX`/`RX` must not become the US state (Teksas, Техас, 德克萨斯) on any key.
- **URI / token spacing** — `tcp://`, `Wi-Fi`, and `I2P` must stay contiguous (no CAT `tcp ://` / `Wi - Fi` / `I 2 P`).
- **Flood / advert / room / backbone** — gated by English meaning, not a handful of leaf names (routing Flood, mesh advert, MeshCore/RRC room, network backbone — not water, ads, hotels, or spines).
- **Routing-port identifiers** — `NodeInfo`, `Telemetry`, `NeighborInfo`, `DiscoveryFlood`, `RoomAdvert` must match English verbatim (matched on the English value, not camelCase leaf names).
- **gamesPanel** — resign is forfeit (not quitting a job); draw is a tie (not a sketch/lottery); challenge/threefold are chess terms.
- **Repeaters CLI danger confirm** (`repeatersPanel.cliDangerConfirmAction`) — confirm button must be translated and must not read like “delete” or other false friends.
- **`repeatersPanel.cliMultiHopHint`** — must describe **multi-hop** CLI and automatic **Ping** before the first command, not multi-tab UI wording.

Full rule set: `scripts/check-i18n-quality.mjs` and `scripts/check-i18n-quality.test.mjs`.

### Adding a New Language

If you would like to help us add support for a new language:

1. Check existing issues to see if someone is already working on it.
2. Open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/mesh-client/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) specifically for the new language.
3. We will help you set up the initial locale files and guide you through the translation process.

## Offline Support

Translations are bundled as static JSON files within the application. Unlike many web apps, Mesh-Client **does not make network calls** to fetch translations at runtime. This ensures that the interface remains in your preferred language even when you are operating off-grid or in environments with no internet access.
