# Agent subsystem reference

Deep, file-level subsystem detail for AI assistants, split out of [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) so it is loaded on demand rather than on every prompt. Hard rules and the always-on workflow/security/style policy stay in `AGENTS.md`; open the matching file here when a task touches that subsystem.
