## Workflows

| Workflow                    | Trigger                                      | Purpose                                                                         |

---

## CI Build (`ci.yaml`)

Runs on every push, pull request, and merge-queue `merge_group` for `main` (and `workflow_dispatch`). Independent lanes start concurrently; only Flatpak waits for change detection:

- **Code quality:** format, markdownlint, license allowlist, actionlint, dependency audit, and yamllint
- **ESLint:** full repository lint with two workers, using `eslint.ci.config.mjs` to avoid running Prettier again for extensions already covered by the required Code quality job. All type-aware rules and the zero-warning gate remain enabled; local lint still checks formatting.
- **Typecheck:** `pnpm run typecheck`
- **Application build:** `pnpm run build`
- **Flatpak checks:** only when Flatpak inputs change; runs `check:flatpak`, `check:flatpak-offline-pnpm`, `desktop-file-validate`, and `appstreamcli validate`
- **Policy scanners:** cheap always-on `check:*` set from pre-commit/release (`check:electron-security`, log/XSS/console/IPC/protocol-string gates, and the matching cheap scanners) so `--no-verify` and GitHub-only edits cannot skip them

Each Node lane uses the same pinned Node 22/pnpm setup action and frozen install. The final `Build & Test` job aggregates every lane so the existing required check name remains stable. Superseded runs for the same pull request or ref are cancelled.

---

## Buttonmash (`buttonmash.yaml`)

Runs a bounded, deterministic Buttonmash crawl on pull requests, merge-queue refs, and manual
dispatches. The job starts the Vite renderer in plain-browser development mode, which installs the
repository's no-op `electronAPI` stub. This exercises the UI shell and browser-safe panel behavior
without accessing radios, native dialogs, SQLite, MQTT, or other Electron-only services.

The workflow pins Buttonmash's action commit and npm version, refuses live billing, fails on `high`
or `critical` findings, and uploads both the Buttonmash report and the Vite server log when a run
fails. The detector config ignores the browser stub's expected no-peripheral BLE rejection and two
exact third-party teardown races from `lucide-react-motion` and Leaflet. Native BLE behavior remains
covered outside this stubbed lane, while all other high-severity browser errors remain blocking. The
action and time budgets live in [`buttonmash.config.json`](../buttonmash.config.json).

---

## Tests (`tests.yaml`)

Runs on every push, pull request, and merge-queue `merge_group` for `main`:

1. **Detect scope:** compare a pull request head with its true merge base and reuse the local staged-test planner to select related paths and Vitest projects.
2. **Pull requests:** run `vitest related` without coverage for the affected project lanes. Docs-only changes skip Vitest. Shared contracts select all projects.
3. **Safe fallback:** test infrastructure, dependency manifests, deleted/renamed paths, oversized output, or detector failures run the full matrix.
4. **Protected events:** `merge_group`, pushes to `main`, and manual runs always run full coverage across `renderer-ui`, `renderer-logic`, and `main`.
5. **Sharding:** `renderer-ui` runs in three shards; `renderer-logic` and `main` each run once. This applies to both related tests and full coverage. Full runs upload blob reports; related runs write JUnit reports named `junit-<project>-<shard>-<total>.xml` and print results in each shard's log. The existing `Coverage (...)` required checks verify that detection and every shard succeeded.
6. **Merge job:** collect related JUnit reports without checkout, Node/pnpm setup, or dependency installation. Full runs (protected events and PRs that cannot be safely scoped) still run `pnpm run test:coverage:merge` to enforce global thresholds.
7. **`reticulum-sidecar-coverage`:** when sidecar paths change, clone the `.rsstack/` workspace, run `cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 45`, and upload `lcov.info`.
8. Upload the `vitest-report` artifact (retained 7 days): separate JUnit files for related shards, including empty shards and available reports from failed runs; one merged `junit.xml` for full runs.

The three `Coverage (...)` job names and `Merge coverage` remain stable for the repository ruleset, including when a project or the whole test matrix has no relevant PR work. Superseded runs for the same pull request or ref are cancelled.

Static analysis on PRs is **CodeQL** (security) plus ESLint, Clippy, and pre-commit `check:*` scanners. AI PR review is **CodeRabbit** (see [CodeRabbit](#coderabbit) below). SonarQube Cloud is not used.

Test results are available as a downloadable artifact from the workflow run.

### Electron E2E (`e2e.yaml`)

Not a PR gate. Runs on a **daily schedule** (default branch only) and on **manual** `workflow_dispatch`:

1. Checkout (`persist-credentials: false`), setup pnpm + Node 22, `node scripts/check-environment.mjs --skip-node-modules`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then `pnpm run check:environment` (`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1`)
2. Linux (`ubuntu-24.04`): install Electron runtime libraries (`libatk-bridge2.0-0t64`, `libgtk-3-0t64`, `libasound2t64`, …) + `xvfb`
3. `pnpm run build` (unpackaged `dist-electron` + renderer)
4. `pnpm run test:e2e` (Linux under `xvfb-run -a`; macOS/Windows plain) — Playwright launches the local Electron binary via `resolveLocalElectronBin()` with an isolated `--user-data-dir`
5. On failure, upload `test-results/` + `playwright-report/` (7-day retention)

Local: `pnpm run test:e2e:build`. See [development-environment.md](development-environment.md#playwright-electron-e2e).

### Reticulum sidecar (`reticulum-sidecar.yaml`)

Path-filtered on `reticulum-sidecar/**` and related scripts:

1. **`lint` job (ubuntu-latest)** — `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy` with `rns-stack,rns-ble,rns-rnode-tcp` (`-D warnings`)
2. **Build matrix** — stub + full-stack `cargo test` and release builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The WoA arm64 jobs cross-compile release binaries on Windows x64 runners; the Windows x64 matrix jobs run the corresponding host tests once.

The two WoA jobs cache Cargo downloads and compiled dependencies with `Swatinem/rust-cache`, separately by job and Rust toolchain. The sidecar workspace crate is excluded from the cache. Every run still clones the current Ratspeak sources, applies overlays, and invokes Cargo to rebuild changed path dependencies and the ARM64 executable. A cache miss performs a normal release build.

CI and local **dev** clones float the `.rsstack/` workspace via `scripts/clone-ratspeak-stack.sh` to `origin/main` (overlays must apply; optional `RS_RETICULUM_REF` / `RS_LXMF_REF` / `RS_NOMAD_REF` / `RS_LXST_REF` / `RS_LRGP_REF` for bisect only — CI never pins Ratspeak SHAs). Open upstream feature PRs needed before they land on `main` (e.g. [rsReticulum#26](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/pull/26) ReplyFile, [rsLXMF#7](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsLXMF/pull/7) multi-file attachments) are carried as overlays under `reticulum-sidecar/patches/` and tracked by `RATSPEAK_PATCH_ENTRIES` in `scripts/update.sh`. **Release** packaging (`scripts/build-reticulum-sidecar-release.mjs`) runs the same clone and records the resolved commit SHAs for all five crates in `.rsstack/RESOLVED_SHAS.txt` so artifacts retain the exact source revisions used — set `RS_*_REF` only when a release must not float.

Local parity: `pnpm run reticulum:sidecar:clippy:full`, `pnpm run check:reticulum-sidecar` (pre-commit full-feature). See [development-environment.md](development-environment.md#reticulum-sidecar-optional).

---

## CodeRabbit

PR review comments come from [CodeRabbit](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/) via [`.coderabbit.yaml`](../.coderabbit.yaml) (quiet profile, path filters, auto-pause after two reviewed commits).

- Prefer opening as a **draft** until the feature diff is ready, then mark ready for review.
- Free plan: about **1 PR review per developer per hour**; each auto-incremental push counts. After auto-pause, request another pass with `@coderabbitai review`.
- Batch actionable findings via the **Prompt for AI Agents** block into one local commit (Autofix requires Pro).
- Check remaining allowance with `@coderabbitai rate limit`.

---

## Release (`release.yaml`)

Triggered by pushing a version tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`):

1. **`schema-release-compare`** — first job; compares this SHA’s `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` to the last **published** GitHub Release (paginated Releases API; highest semver among non-draft/non-prerelease rows; recovers `vX.Y.Z` from release **name** only when `tag_name` is missing or `untagged-*`), writes the Actions step summary, and uploads a schema readme artifact. Job outputs feed installer notices and the draft release body.
2. **`prepare-github-release`** — **sole** creator of the draft GitHub release for the tag (`MESH_CLIENT_ALLOW_DRAFT_CREATE=1`), exports `release_id` (reconstructed from validated digits before `GITHUB_OUTPUT` — CodeQL `js/http-to-file-access`), then prepends the schema compare note (via `RELEASE_ID`, not List Releases). On `workflow_dispatch`, the tag is resolved in the workflow from `package.json` and passed as `RELEASE_TAG` (not read inside the release API script — avoids CodeQL `js/file-access-to-http`). The schema note is rebuilt from `schema-release-compare` job outputs (`MESH_CLIENT_SCHEMA_*`), not from a downloaded markdown artifact (same CodeQL rule).
3. Installs Linux build dependencies (`libudev-dev`, `rpm`, …) on `ubuntu-latest` runners
4. Rebuilds native dependencies (`pnpm run rebuild`)
5. **Stamp CI build info** — `scripts/ci-write-build-info-env.mjs` writes `MESH_CLIENT_BUILD_INFO` (`buildChannel=release` + tag + Actions `runUrl`) into `$GITHUB_ENV` before `dist:*` so support-bundle `manifest.json` and startup logs identify an official release build (see [Build channel stamp](#build-channel-stamp-test-vs-release)).
6. Builds for all three platforms in parallel (or a filtered subset on `workflow_dispatch`) with **`--publish never`**:
   - `macos-latest` → `pnpm run dist:mac`
   - `ubuntu-latest` → `pnpm run dist:linux`
   - `windows-latest` → `pnpm run dist:win`
7. **`ci-upload-release-assets.mjs`** attaches installers / update metadata to the prepare `release_id` (never `POST /releases`) via `gh api --input` path uploads (avoids CodeQL `js/file-access-to-http` from `readFile` → `fetch`). `finalize-github-release` still consolidates if anything external forked drafts.

Linux packaging smoke (`verify-linux-packaging.mjs`) asserts `.deb` **Description** metadata is ASCII-only. See [Release Process](release-process.md).

See [Release Process](release-process.md) for the maintainer workflow.

---

## Flatpak (`flatpak.yaml`)

Builds Flatpak bundles using [`flatpak/flatpak-github-actions`](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-github-actions).

**Triggers:** version tags (`v*`) and manual `workflow_dispatch` (**Build Flatpak (no release)**).

A matrix builds **x86_64** and **aarch64** in parallel. Both use the same privileged `ghcr.io/flathub-infra/flatpak-github-actions:freedesktop-24.08` container (Flathub remote, `flatpak-builder`, and system-scope runtime installs). **x86_64** runs on `ubuntu-latest`; **aarch64** runs on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` (native ARM runners — not QEMU on bare Ubuntu).

1. **`schema-release-compare`** — same compare as Build Binaries / Release; uploads `READ-ME-FIRST-flatpak.md` and feeds `write-schema-upgrade-notice.mjs` so bumped schemas embed `SCHEMA-UPGRADE.txt` under Flatpak `resources/`
2. Builds the Reticulum sidecar on bare Ubuntu runners, then generates `flatpak/generated-sources.json` via `flatpak-node-generator`
3. Stamps CI build info (`test` on dispatch / `release` on tag), builds from `org.coloradomesh.MeshClient.yml` with offline pnpm sources
4. Smoke-installs the unstamped local bundle; on **dispatch only**, renames to `org.coloradomesh.MeshClient-run{N}.flatpak`
5. Uploads `org.coloradomesh.MeshClient.flatpak-{x86_64,aarch64}.flatpak` artifacts (file basename stamped on test builds) plus per-arch `flatpak-schema-warning-*`

On **version tag pushes**, a `publish` job waits for the Electron `prepare-github-release` draft (`ci-wait-github-draft-release.mjs`), then attaches both **clean-named** bundles with `ci-upload-release-assets.mjs` (never creates a release). aarch64 is the primary ARM Linux install path (release `build.yaml` only produces x86_64 AppImage/deb/rpm).

`flatpak/generated-sources.json` is generated automatically in CI by `flatpak-node-generator` before each build — it does not need to be committed to the repo. For local builds, generate it manually; see [development-environment.md](development-environment.md) for steps. If submitting to Flathub's dedicated submission repo, the file must be committed there.

---

## Third-party licenses (`third-party-licenses.yaml`)

After merges to `main` that change `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, the generator script, or this workflow (and on `workflow_dispatch`):

1. Checkout with `persist-credentials: false` (avoids Duplicate Authorization with create-pull-request)
2. Setup pnpm + Node 22
3. Install dependencies (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`)
4. Audit licenses (`pnpm run check:licenses`)
5. Regenerate `docs/third-party-licenses.md` (`pnpm run docs:licenses`)
6. Open a PR via `peter-evans/create-pull-request` when the file changed (branch `chore/third-party-licenses-<run_id>`)

**Secret:** reuse **`RELEASE_PUSH_TOKEN`** (admin PAT with **contents**, **workflows**, and **pull requests** write). Default `GITHUB_TOKEN` PRs do not auto-run required checks, so they cannot enter the merge queue cleanly. Direct pushes to `main` remain blocked by the merge-queue ruleset. The workflow probes Contents write (create/delete a short-lived ref) before `create-pull-request` so a token missing write access fails with a clear error instead of a git 403.

---

## Docs (`docs.yml`)

Deploys documentation to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`:

1. Checkout code
2. Setup Python 3.x
3. Install MkDocs dependencies (`docs/requirements.txt`)
4. Copy `README.md` → `docs/index.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` → `docs/contributing.md`
5. Rewrite doc links for MkDocs
6. Deploy with `mkdocs gh-deploy --force`

---

## Dependabot

Automated dependency updates are configured in `.github/dependabot.yml`:

- **Schedule:** Weekly on Saturdays
- **npm dependencies:** Grouped PRs (Electron separate, all other deps together)
- **GitHub Actions:** Grouped into one PR
- **Open PRs:** `open-pull-requests-limit: 0` — Dependabot scans but does **not** open PRs.
  Dependency bumps are applied manually via `pnpm run update` (`scripts/update.sh`), which
  also runs dedupe, Ratspeak overlay PR checks
  ([rsReticulum#26](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/pull/26) ReplyFile and
  [rsLXMF#7](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsLXMF/pull/7) multi-file attachments are overlays
  on floated `origin/main` — see `reticulum-sidecar/patches/README.md`), and an upstream
  release / new-org-repo watch (rsLXST, lrgp-rs, Ratspeak Games-parity when a newer published
  release exists, LXMFace `js/lxmface.js` commit). Sibling **rsReticulum** /
  **rsLXMF** / **rsNomad** / **rsLXST** / **lrgp-rs** float to `origin/main` via
  `clone-ratspeak-stack.sh` (overlays must apply; no committed SHA pins). See AGENTS.md §6.

### Testing Dependabot PRs locally

Use **pnpm** (not npm) to test dependabot PRs:

```bash
git checkout <dependabot-branch>
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:run
```

Do not use `npm install`; it will create a `package-lock.json` and may not respect pnpm's lockfile format.

## Running CI Locally with `act`

**Optional tooling:** You can run local CI in two ways:

| Mode                    | Command prefix                                           | Requires                                                        | What it does                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Container** (default) | `pnpm run act:ci`, `pnpm run act:tests`, …               | Docker-compatible engine + [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) | Runs GitHub Actions jobs inside Linux containers (closest to CI)              |
| **Host / native**       | `pnpm run act:ci:native`, `pnpm run act:tests:native`, … | Node/pnpm only                                                  | Runs the same pnpm/cargo steps directly on your machine (no container engine) |

Container mode runs GitHub Actions jobs inside Linux containers using a Docker-compatible engine (Podman preferred). Host mode runs the same pnpm/cargo steps directly — use this when no container engine is available or act cannot reach the daemon. `pnpm run check:environment` warns if no container engine or act is missing but does not block commits. Use **native** scripts when no Docker-compatible engine is available or act cannot reach the daemon.

Docker `pnpm run act:ci` runs the real `ci.yaml` work jobs (`quality`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `app-build`, `policy-scanners`) in sequence. It does **not** invoke the `Build & Test` aggregator (`build`) — that job only checks sibling results on GitHub so the required check name stays stable. Path-filtered Flatpak checks are not part of container `act:ci` (native `act:ci:native` still runs them; or change Flatpak inputs and use the `flatpak` job / `act:flatpak`).

**macOS note:** [Podman Desktop](https://podman.io/) is the preferred Docker-compatible engine for local CI. When Docker compatibility is enabled, Podman exposes a Docker-compatible socket at `/var/run/docker.sock`; pass that path to `act` via `ACT_DOCKER_SOCKET`, or let `act` detect it automatically if Podman created the symlink. If you use Docker Desktop instead, its socket is typically under `~/.docker/run/docker.sock`.

Install act (container mode only):

```bash
# macOS
brew install act

# Linux / Windows
# https://github.com/nektos/act/releases
```

On Windows, Podman Desktop with Docker compatibility is preferred. If you use Docker Desktop instead, use the WSL2 backend. On Apple Silicon, `act` uses `--container-architecture linux/amd64` automatically for x86_64 CI parity.

**Podman:** `scripts/run-act.mjs` passes `--container-daemon-socket` to `act` (auto-detects `/var/run/docker.sock` on macOS). If `act` still cannot connect, set `ACT_DOCKER_SOCKET` to your socket path or use native mode. If you use Docker Desktop instead, its socket is typically under `~/.docker/run/docker.sock`.

### Package scripts

```bash
# One-time (container mode)
pnpm run act:pull-images

# List targets
pnpm run act:list

# PR parity — container (act + Podman/Docker)
# act:ci runs quality / lint / typecheck / app-build / policy-scanners
# (not the GitHub-only Build & Test aggregator job)
pnpm run act:ci
pnpm run act:tests
pnpm run act:pr

# PR parity — host (no container engine)
pnpm run act:ci:native
pnpm run act:tests:native
pnpm run act:pr:native

# Linux packaging
pnpm run act:build:linux        # container
pnpm run act:build:linux:native # host (best on Linux)

# Heavier workflows (container only unless noted)
pnpm run act:reticulum
pnpm run act:reticulum:native # stub sidecar cargo test/build on host
pnpm run act:flatpak          # docker only

# Override mode on one invocation
node scripts/run-act.mjs ci --native
node scripts/run-act.mjs ci --docker
MESH_CLIENT_ACT_MODE=native pnpm run act:ci

# Dry-run passthrough (container mode)
node scripts/run-act.mjs ci -- -n
```

### What runs locally vs native OS only

| Goal                                    | Container (`act:*`)    | Host (`act:*:native`)       | macOS host only        | Windows host only      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| PR checks (lint / test / build)         | `act:ci` + `act:tests` | `act:ci:native` + `:native` | same                   | same                   |
| Linux installers (AppImage / deb / rpm) | `act:build:linux`      | `act:build:linux:native`    | cross-build may differ | cross-build may differ |
| macOS `.dmg` / `.zip`                   | —                      | —                           | `pnpm run dist:mac`    | —                      |
| Windows `.exe`                          | —                      | —                           | —                      | `pnpm run dist:win`    |
| Flatpak x86_64                          | `act:flatpak`          | use local Flatpak docs      | same                   | same                   |

**Not run locally via act:** `docs.yml` (`mkdocs gh-deploy`), release publish legs, `macos-latest` / `windows-latest` / `windows-11-vs2026-arm` matrix jobs, and `ubuntu-24.04-arm` Flatpak builds (no faithful local emulation).

Note: The test results artifact upload step is automatically skipped when running under `act` (detected by actor `nektos/act` in [`tests.yaml`](../.github/workflows/tests.yaml)).

## Merge queue and rulesets

`main` is protected by a **repository ruleset** (not classic branch protection) that:

1. Requires a pull request before merging
2. Requires **at least one approving review** before the merge queue
3. Requires a **merge queue**
4. Requires **strict** status checks (must pass on the merge group / up-to-date tip)
5. Blocks force-pushes and branch deletion on `main`

### Required check names (always-on)

Only checks that report on every PR and every `merge_group` run are required:

| Check name                  | Workflow     |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| `Build & Test`              | `ci.yaml`    |
| `Coverage (renderer-ui)`    | `tests.yaml` |
| `Coverage (renderer-logic)` | `tests.yaml` |
| `Coverage (main)`           | `tests.yaml` |
| `Merge coverage`            | `tests.yaml` |

Each required check is pinned with `integration_id` **15368** (GitHub Actions) in [`.github/rulesets/main-merge-queue.json`](../.github/rulesets/main-merge-queue.json).

**Do not** add these as required (they skip or are not PR/`merge_group` gates and would stall the queue):

- `Reticulum sidecar coverage` (path-filtered)
- `fmt + clippy` / sidecar build matrix (`reticulum-sidecar.yaml`, path-filtered)
- CodeQL `Analyze (*)` — **default setup does not run on `merge_group`**; CodeQL still runs on PRs/pushes. Requiring it would hang the merge queue until advanced setup + `merge_group` exists.
- E2E, packaging smoke, Flatpak, release jobs

`ci.yaml` and `tests.yaml` both listen for `merge_group` so the queue’s temporary ref re-runs the same gates.

### Bypass actors

- **Repository admins** (`RepositoryRole` id 5) — emergency hotfixes and local `pnpm run release` (direct push of bump commit + tag to `main`)

GitHub Actions **cannot** be added as a bypass actor on this organization (“must be part of the ruleset source or owner organization”). [`third-party-licenses.yaml`](../.github/workflows/third-party-licenses.yaml) therefore opens a PR (via `RELEASE_PUSH_TOKEN`) instead of pushing to `main`.

**Pull request gate:** one approving review, **dismiss stale reviews on push**, and **require last push approval** so an approved PR cannot enter the merge queue after unreviewed follow-up commits.

### Applying / updating the ruleset

Canonical JSON lives at [`.github/rulesets/main-merge-queue.json`](../.github/rulesets/main-merge-queue.json) (live ruleset id **20821455**). Vitest contract: `scripts/main-merge-queue-ruleset.test.mjs` (pinned checks + review gates). After changing the JSON, **PUT the live ruleset** or drift will remain until someone syncs:

```bash
# Update live ruleset from canonical JSON
gh api repos/Colorado-Mesh/mesh-client/rulesets/20821455 \
  --method PUT \
  --input .github/rulesets/main-merge-queue.json
```

`gh api --input` can hit HTTP/2 content-length issues on create; if that fails, POST the JSON body with Python `urllib` (same payload).

The ruleset is already **active** with `merge_group` triggers on `ci.yaml` / `tests.yaml`. Keep those triggers if you ever recreate the ruleset — enabling the queue without them leaves required checks pending forever.

---

## Required Status Checks

All PRs (and merge-queue groups) for `main` must pass the **required check names** listed above. Those jobs cover:

- Lint, format, markdown, licenses, actionlint, yamllint (`pnpm run lint` and related steps in `ci.yaml`)
- Cheap always-on policy scanners (`check:electron-security`, log/XSS/console/IPC/protocol-string gates, and the matching cheap `check:*` set)
- Typecheck and build (`pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run build`)
- Affected Vitest tests on pull requests; full Vitest with global coverage thresholds on `merge_group`, `main`, and manual runs

---

## Pre-commit Hook

The pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs checks beyond what GitHub Actions runs directly:

- **Staged-file** Prettier + markdownlint (not a full-tree `pnpm run format` / `lint:md`)
- `pnpm dedupe` when dependency manifests are staged
- `pnpm run i18n:auto-translate` when `en/translation.json` is staged (fills new English keys vs `HEAD`) + re-stages locales
- Staged ESLint (`--cache`) + full `typecheck`; path-gated `typecheck:strict-shared` when shared paths staged; always-on cheap `check:*` scanners; path-gated flatpak / DB / IPC / reticulum catalog / full-feature sidecar checks (sidecar also requires `cargo` on `PATH` when sidecar paths are staged; `check:i18n` when English locale staged, else `check:i18n:branch`)
- Before PR: `pnpm run check:pr` (full lint + typecheck + strict-shared + `test:run` + path-aware sidecar)
- `pnpm audit` only when dependency manifests staged; `actionlint` / `yamllint` only when relevant files are staged
- `pnpm run test:staged` (`scripts/precommit-tests.mjs`: staged-only `vitest related`; full suite when vitest config/setup mocks or dependency manifests change; skip when no source/test staged)

**PR CI** ([`tests.yaml`](../.github/workflows/tests.yaml)) selects merge-base-related Vitest work and fails closed to the full suite when scoping is unsafe. The merge queue and **`pnpm run release`** always run full Vitest; green pre-commit does not replace those gates.

CI focuses on lint, typecheck, build, cheap always-on policy scanners, Flatpak metadata validation, and coverage tests. i18n quality is enforced locally via pre-commit and indirectly in CI through Vitest (`locale-quality.test.ts`).

## Troubleshooting

### CI fails but passes locally

- Ensure you're using Node 22 (same as CI)
- Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` to match CI's exact dependency versions
- Check for platform-specific differences (paths, case sensitivity)

### Release workflow fails

- Verify the tag follows semantic versioning (`v1.2.3`)
- Ensure `GH_TOKEN` secret is set in repository settings
- Check that `dist:*` / `dist:*:publish` scripts exist in `package.json` (tag release CI uses `dist:*` + `ci-upload-release-assets.mjs`)

### Docs deployment fails

- Verify `docs/requirements.txt` dependencies are valid
- Check MkDocs configuration in `mkdocs.yml`
- Ensure all referenced doc files exist

## Packaging smoke builds (`build.yaml` / `flatpak.yaml` / `release.yaml`)

### Build channel stamp (test vs release)

**Build Binaries** (`build.yaml`), **Release** (`release.yaml`), and **Build Flatpak** (`flatpak.yaml`) run `scripts/ci-write-build-info-env.mjs` before packaging. That writes a JSON `MESH_CLIENT_BUILD_INFO` blob into `$GITHUB_ENV`, which `scripts/esbuild-main-build.mjs` embeds via esbuild `--define` into the main process. Flatpak also writes `flatpak/ci-build-info.json` (gitignored) so the sandbox `pnpm run build` sees the same env.

| Channel   | Workflow                                                | Support-bundle `manifest.json`                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test`    | Build Binaries (no release); Build Flatpak (no release) | `buildChannel: "test"` + `buildInfo.runUrl` (Actions run) |
| `release` | Build/Release Electron App; Build Flatpak (tag)         | `buildChannel: "release"` + `tag` + `buildInfo.runUrl`    |
| `local`   | unmarked `pnpm run dist` / dev / local Flatpak          | `buildChannel: "local"` only                              |

`appVersion` remains `package.json` semver (unchanged). Use `buildChannel` + `buildInfo.runUrl` when triaging Export for GitHub / Developer zips so a test binary is not mistaken for an official release. Startup logs include a compact fragment (`buildChannel=… run=… runId=… sha=…`).

**Which binary am I running?** If a tester says they downloaded Actions run N but the app reports a different run, open **Export for GitHub** → `manifest.json` → `buildInfo.runUrl` (authoritative), or the `[Startup] runtime … run=…` line in the app log. Same-semver test installers used to share identical filenames across runs; test builds now stamp `-run{N}` into downloadable basenames (see below).

### Test-build installer filenames (`-run{N}`)

**Test / one-off only** — never official GitHub Release assets:

| Workflow       | When                       | Filename stamp                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build.yaml`   | Always (dispatch-only)     | After `dist:*`, `scripts/rename-test-build-artifacts.mjs` renames AppImage/deb/rpm/DMG/ZIP/Setup under `release/` to include `-run{GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}` (e.g. `Mesh-client-5.26.0-run214.AppImage`, `Mesh-client-Setup-5.26.0-run214.exe`) |
| `flatpak.yaml` | `workflow_dispatch` only   | After in-job smoke, rename to `org.coloradomesh.MeshClient-run{N}.flatpak`, then upload                                                                                                                                                   |
| `flatpak.yaml` | tag `v*` (release publish) | Clean `org.coloradomesh.MeshClient.flatpak` (no `-run{N}`)                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `release.yaml` | tag publish                | Clean electron-builder names (no rename step)                                                                                                                                                                                             |

`packaging-smoke` on Build Binaries downloads **stamped** names (Windows Setup matcher accepts default or `-run{N}`). Flatpak smoke always uses the unstamped local path **before** rename. Manual Flatpak runs use Actions run title **`Build Flatpak (no release)`**; tag runs use **`Build Flatpak`**.

### Schema compare vs last official release

**Build Binaries**, **Build Flatpak**, and **Release** start with a **`schema-release-compare`** job (`scripts/ci-schema-release-compare.mjs`) that:

1. Labels **Build Binaries** / **Build Flatpak (no release)** runs as a **test build** (not an official release) in `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`
2. Compares this tree’s `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` to the last published (non-draft) GitHub Release tag
3. Uploads `READ-ME-FIRST-test-build.md` (build) / `READ-ME-FIRST-flatpak.md` (flatpak) / `READ-ME-FIRST-schema.md` (release). **Build Binaries** stages the note into `release/` before platform uploads so `upload-artifact`’s least-common-ancestor stays under `release/` (mixing `release-warnings/` nests installers as `release/release/*.exe` and breaks `packaging-smoke`). Flatpak keeps a separate per-arch `flatpak-schema-warning-*` artifact beside the bundle
4. Exposes `schema_bumped` / `curr_schema` / `prev_schema` / `prev_tag` for packaging

Packaging always runs `scripts/write-schema-upgrade-notice.mjs`. On a schema bump it writes the Windows NSIS MessageBox include and `SCHEMA-UPGRADE.txt` for macOS/Linux/Flatpak (`electron-builder-before-pack.mjs` / Flatpak `resources/` copy). With no bump it still writes a no-op `resources/schema-upgrade-notice.nsh` stub — NSIS `!include` of a missing file is warning 7000, and electron-builder treats warnings as errors.

On first launch after a schema bump against an existing database, the app shows a blocking **Quit / Upgrade** dialog before mutating SQLite (see [Release Process — Database schema upgrades](release-process.md#database-schema-upgrades)).

Linux arm64 cross-builds on Ubuntu 24.04 runners use `scripts/ci-setup-linux-arm64-apt.sh` before `dpkg --add-architecture arm64`. The script pins `Architectures: amd64` only on deb822 stanzas in `ubuntu.sources` that lack an `Architectures` field, writes arm64 ports mirrors as deb822 `arm64.sources` (not legacy `.list`), and is idempotent across workflow re-runs.

Reticulum sidecar staging before `electron-builder`:

- `scripts/build-reticulum-sidecar-release.mjs` — compile/copy sidecar per target OS/arch
- `scripts/verify-reticulum-sidecar-staged.mjs` — size/assert checks
- `scripts/electron-builder-before-pack.mjs` — copy into `resources/reticulum-sidecar/`

Post-build smoke tests:

### macOS packaging verify (`verify-mac-packaging.mjs`)

- **`scripts/verify-mac-packaging.mjs`** — macOS packaging guard (runs after `dist:mac` / `dist:mac:publish` and in `packaging-smoke` on tag releases). Validates:
  - **Both x64 and arm64** `.dmg` / `.zip` artifacts under `release/` (path or file-name markers), each above minimum size
  - Bundle layout via **direct `.app`** (every complete on-disk bundle), **`ditto -xk` ZIP extract for every ZIP**, and **`hdiutil attach` for every DMG** (not only the largest archive)
  - DMG mount root includes an **`Applications` → `/Applications` symlink** and **`IMPORTANT-Read-Me.txt`** (7-Zip / bad ZIP extract warning; prefer DMG or [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/)) — drag-to-install layout from `electron-builder.yml` `dmg.contents`
  - **Electron Framework symlinks** (`Versions/Current`, root `Electron Framework`) remain symlinks — `upload-artifact` dereferences them and breaks the bundle (~3× framework bloat)
  - **Squirrel / Mantle / ReactiveObjC** framework symlinks and binaries (7-Zip flattening breaks Squirrel at launch)
  - Staged **`00-READ-ME-BEFORE-EXTRACTING-macOS-ZIP.txt`** uploaded beside macOS ZIP/DMG on GitHub Releases
  - Thin **MacOS launcher** + full **Electron Framework** binary sizes; bundled **Reticulum sidecar** present
  - **Developer ID–signed builds only:** `codesign --verify --deep --strict` on the finished `.app` (DMG mount / ZIP extract / on-disk), `xcrun stapler validate` (stapled notarization ticket), and `codesign --verify --strict` on the bundled Reticulum sidecar. Unsigned or ad-hoc (non–Developer ID) local `dist:mac` builds skip this gate.
  - CI uploads **DMG/ZIP only** — never raw `Mesh-client.app` (see comment in `release.yaml` **Upload macOS Artifact**)
  - Optional signing env (`CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY`) is passed through from workflow secrets on `macos-latest`; layout checks do not require them, but signed CI builds must pass the codesign/stapler gate above
- `scripts/test-linux-appimage-reticulum-sidecar.mjs` — x64 uses `--appimage-extract`; arm64 on x64 runners uses `unsquashfs` for cross-arch extract
- `scripts/test-win-nsis-install.mjs` — NSIS + 7z sidecar probe on WoA

Local packaging parity: see [development-environment.md](development-environment.md#reticulum-sidecar-optional).
