# CodeQL configuration

## Why there is no `codeql.yml` workflow

This repository uses **CodeQL default setup** (enabled under **Settings → Code security and analysis → Code scanning**). When default setup is on, GitHub **rejects SARIF uploads** from the CodeQL action to avoid duplicate/conflicting alerts. See:

- [Upload was rejected because CodeQL default setup is enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif-uploads/default-setup-enabled)

So the previous workflow that ran `github/codeql-action` with a custom `config-file` failed in CI with:

> CodeQL analyses from advanced configurations cannot be processed when the default setup is enabled

Default setup already runs JavaScript/TypeScript analysis on push/PR; no separate workflow is required for scanning to occur.

## `js/insecure-temporary-file` (tests and scripts)

CodeQL flags `writeFile` / `writeFileSync` / similar to a **predictable** path under the OS temp directory (e.g. `path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'fake-sidecar')`). This commonly appears in Vitest fixtures and repeatedly fails PR Code Scanning.

**Fix (required):** create a unique directory first, then write inside it:

```ts
const dir = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'mesh-fixture-'));
const file = path.join(dir, 'stub');
fs.writeFileSync(file, '');
```

Do **not** rely on dismissals for new findings. Local/pre-commit guard: `pnpm run check:insecure-temp-files` (see AGENTS.md §3).

## `js/http-to-file-access` and `codeql-config.yml`

[`js/http-to-file-access`](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-http-to-file-access/) is a path-problem query whose sink is the **data argument** to `appendFile` / `writeFileSync` (a narrow source span), not the whole statement. GitHub’s `// codeql[query-id]` suppression logic matches alerts whose location is a **whole line** (`startcolumn`/`endcolumn` zero); it does **not** suppress these argument-level sinks, so inline comments do not clear the alert.

[`codeql-config.yml`](./codeql-config.yml) **excludes** `js/http-to-file-access` because our disk writes are sanitized log lines to a fixed path, not arbitrary remote-to-file backdoors.

**Important:** **Default setup does not read `codeql-config.yml`.** With default setup only, alerts may still appear until you **dismiss** them in the Security / PR UI (false positive, with justification pointing to CONTRIBUTING) **or** switch to **advanced** CodeQL and pass this config.

## Using advanced setup with `codeql-config.yml`

1. In **Settings → Code security and analysis → Code scanning**, disable CodeQL default setup (so SARIF from Actions is accepted).
2. Add a workflow that runs `github/codeql-action/init@v4` with `config-file: ./.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` and `analyze` as documented.

Do not run both default setup and a CodeQL workflow that uploads SARIF for the same scope; GitHub will reject the upload.

## Embedded model pack (`extensions/`)

[Default setup](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/editing-your-configuration-of-default-setup#extending-codeql-coverage-with-codeql-model-packs-in-default-setup) loads **CodeQL model packs** from `.github/codeql/extensions/`.

This repo ships **`mesh-client-models`**: data extensions that mark `sanitizeForLogSink`, `sanitizeLogMessage`, `sanitizeForConsoleEcho`, and `sanitizeLogPayloadForDisk` as **barriers** where applicable. Main-process **terminal echo** uses `sanitizeForConsoleEcho`, which applies CodeQL’s built-in newline sanitizer pattern (empty replacement) before whitespace normalization (see [Log injection query help](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-log-injection/)).

**Log injection (`js/log-injection`):** `barrierModel` rows with kind **`log-injection`** attach to that query because the library defines `SanitizerFromModel` via `ModelOutput::barrierNode(_, "log-injection")` (see [`LogInjectionQuery.qll`](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/javascript/ql/lib/semmle/javascript/security/dataflow/LogInjectionQuery.qll) on `github/codeql`).

**Network → file (`js/http-to-file-access`):** MaD barrier kinds must be valid **sink** kinds (for example **`file-content-store`** for file-body writes), not the query id. More importantly, [`HttpToFileAccessQuery.qll`](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/javascript/ql/lib/semmle/javascript/security/dataflow/HttpToFileAccessQuery.qll) currently wires barriers only through the abstract `Sanitizer` class and does **not** include a `SanitizerFromModel` for any MaD kind; so **`barrierModel` cannot clear this query until upstream adds that hook** (or you rely on [`codeql-config.yml`](./codeql-config.yml) query filters under **advanced** setup). We still model `sanitizeLogPayloadForDisk` as a **`file-content-store`** barrier for correctness and forward compatibility.

Each pack directory includes **`qlpack.yml`** and a duplicate **`codeql-pack.yml`** so default setup resolves metadata reliably; `extensionTargets` must use a real semver range (not `*`), or GitHub may skip loading the pack.

Layout is enforced locally by `pnpm run check:codeql-extensions`. If alerts persist after changing imports or package name, adjust the first column of the `barrierModel` rows in [`extensions/mesh-client-models/models/log-sanitizer-barriers.yml`](./extensions/mesh-client-models/models/log-sanitizer-barriers.yml) to match how CodeQL labels the module (often `package.json` `name` or the relative `src/main/...` path).
