# rsReticulum / rsLXMF overlays

Patches applied on top of [ratspeak/rsReticulum](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum) / [ratspeak/rsLXMF](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsLXMF) checkouts for mesh-client `rns-stack` builds (`.rsstack/rsNomad` from [Colorado-Mesh/rsNomad](https://github.com/Colorado-Mesh/rsNomad) is also required for Nomad hosting; no mesh-client overlay today). Checkouts live in the repo-local `.rsstack/` gitignored workspace, keeping a standalone `rsReticulum` mirror (if present) pristine.

By default `scripts/clone-ratspeak-stack.sh` floats the `.rsstack/` checkouts to **`origin/main`** and applies these overlays (fails loud if a patch will not apply). Use `RS_RETICULUM_REF` / `RS_LXMF_REF` / `RS_NOMAD_REF` only as a manual bisect escape hatch — CI and `pnpm run update` never pin Ratspeak SHAs. Per-overlay **Base commit** tables below record the last regeneration baseline, not a permanent pin — when regenerating, prefer floated `origin/main` and record the short SHA in the PR.

Open upstream feature PRs that mesh-client needs before they land on `main` (for example [rsReticulum#26](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/pull/26) ReplyFile, [rsLXMF#7](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsLXMF/pull/7) multi-file attachments) are carried as **overlays** below — same apply path as other patches. `pnpm run update` tracks them in `RATSPEAK_PATCH_ENTRIES` and warns when the upstream PR merges so the overlay can be removed. Colorado-Mesh/rsNomad floats `origin/main` with **no** mesh-client overlay (NomadNet `/media` is already on main).

## Development — overlays/patches

Overlays require **git checkouts** in the repo-local `.rsstack/` workspace (not a bare Cargo cache path):

- `.rsstack/rsReticulum` — floated to `origin/main` unless `RS_RETICULUM_REF` is set (bisect only)
- `.rsstack/rsLXMF` — floated to `origin/main` unless `RS_LXMF_REF` is set (bisect only)
- `.rsstack/rsNomad` — floated to `origin/main` unless `RS_NOMAD_REF` is set (bisect only)

**First-time setup:**

```bash
# From mesh-client repo root — clones/floats the .rsstack workspace and applies known overlays
./scripts/clone-ratspeak-stack.sh
# Or ensure patches on an existing .rsstack tree:
./scripts/ensure-rsReticulum-patches.sh
```

Apply a single overlay when developing that patch:

```bash
./scripts/apply-rsReticulum-discovery-announce-egress.sh
git -C .rsstack/rsReticulum status --short
```

If a patch is skipped or conflicts after an upstream bump, CI/`ensure-rsReticulum-patches.sh` will fail. Rebase the overlay, regenerate the `.patch` file per the section below, then re-run the apply script.

## rsReticulum-reply-file-query-metadata.patch

Carry [ratspeak/rsReticulum#26](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/pull/26) on floated `origin/main`: `RequestOutcome::ReplyFile`, `pack_file_name_metadata`, 4-arg `set_request_handler_ex` (remote identity), and `LinkClient::query` Resource metadata. Required for Colorado-Mesh/rsNomad NomadNet `/file` and `/media` response Resources.

## Removed: rsReticulum-link-client-nomad.patch

Sunset when floated `origin/main` moved `LinkClient::query` to handler-free `resolve_destination_on_transport` (no HasPath gate, no temporary announce handlers) — the overlay's `discover_remote_public_key` + `await_path` + announce-handler GC is fully superseded. [ratspeak/rsReticulum#14](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/pull/14) was closed as superseded; mesh-client no longer carries the overlay or `scripts/apply-rsReticulum-link-client-nomad.sh`. Tracked entry removed from `RATSPEAK_PATCH_ENTRIES` in `scripts/update.sh` after sunset confirmation.

## rsReticulum-link-client-proof-budget.patch

Keep `LinkClient::query` proof wait on the **remaining overall deadline** (v5.25.0 / release parity). Earlier overlays capped at `establishment_timeout` (hops×6) or `max(establishment, 30s)` and false-failed multi-hop TCP hub Nomad pages (e.g. Northern Ireland) that need the rest of the MeshChat 45s window. The apply script migrates those older caps to remaining-deadline.

On current floated `origin/main`, proof wait is `timeout(time_remaining(deadline)?, wait_for_valid_proof(...))`. The apply script is a **no-op** in that case; keep the patch for older pins.

## Removed: rsReticulum-rnode-tcp-activity-keepalive.patch

Sunset when upstream landed `RNodeIdleProbe` (`88d3d38` — *rnode: restore TCP application idle probes*). [ratspeak/rsReticulum#15](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/pull/15) was closed as superseded; mesh-client no longer carries that overlay (floated `origin/main` already includes idle probes). Tracked entry removed from `RATSPEAK_PATCH_ENTRIES` in `scripts/update.sh` after sunset confirmation.

## rsReticulum-ble-rnode-pairing-transition-debounce.patch

Debounce BLE RNode reconnect after mid-SMP disconnect (`BLE pairing in progress`): wait **30s** instead of **1s** so macOS/Windows OS passkey dialogs are not re-fired while the user enters the PIN.

## rsReticulum-ble-rnode-bond-desync.patch

Halt BLE RNode reconnect when CoreBluetooth reports **Peer removed pairing information**, and skip the TX-char SMP probe on reconnect after a successful session in the same task (fall back to pairing if subscribe fails with auth). Apply **after** the pairing-transition debounce overlay.

The upstream PR is **standalone off `main`** (independent of [#20](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/pull/20) — the bond-desync code does not touch `PAIRING_TRANSITION_RETRY_WAIT`). The local overlay is regenerated on top of the pairing-transition debounce overlay against the generation-owner BLE connect path (`DesktopPairingTrigger` / `run_generation_operation`), so apply it **after** that overlay here.

**Modifies (1 file):**

## rsReticulum-discovery-announce-egress.patch

Register `rnstransport.discovery.interface` as a local destination before announcing, and defer `Announcer::register` until the discoverable interface online latch is true. Without this, Boundary hubs such as **rmap.world** silently drop discovery announces (non-local + no path), and BLE RNode can consume a multi-hour `announce_interval` on a no-op TX while still connecting.

## rsLXMF-propagation-sync-peering.patch

LinkIdentify + peering stamp before LXMF `/offer`, sticky offer/finish fields, plus Establishing diagnostics (`last_establish_error` + warn when LRPROOF is ignored for missing identity or invalid proof) so mesh-client can complete remote PN sync and surface non-generic failures.

## rsLXMF-propagation-node-policy-setters.patch

Live mutators for local PN hosting policy updates (`set_peering_cost`, `set_max_storage`, `set_max_message_size`). Floated rsLXMF tip only exposes `set_min_stamp_cost`; mesh-client `pn_hosting_apply` needs the others so policy edits apply without recreating the node.

## rsLXMF-propagation-node-deferred-messagestore-load.patch

`PropagationNode::with_storage_unloaded` + `load_messagestore_from_disk` so mesh-client can mark live/RRC ready before scanning a large on-disk PN messagestore (tens of thousands of files). `with_storage` remains eager (loads immediately) for callers that need a full store up front.

Expose `LinkDeliveryManager::has_pending_to` so the sidecar can serialize packed Propagated deposits (and propagation sync) against an in-flight Link to the same PN.

## Removed: rsReticulum-pathless-link-exclude-rf.patch

Sunset when [ratspeak/rsReticulum#22](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/issues/22) landed `921eac4` (*transport: bind established Links to exact interfaces*). Established Link TX uses `SendLinkEndpoint` on the establishment interface; generic unattached Link packets are dropped (`dropping unattached locally-originated Link packet`) instead of broadcasting onto every OUT iface. Tracked entry removed from `RATSPEAK_PATCH_ENTRIES` in `scripts/update.sh` after sunset confirmation.

## rsReticulum-announce-rebroadcast-exclude-rf.patch

With `enable_transport`, rsReticulum enqueues rebroadcasted mesh announces onto every eligible OUT iface, including flow-controlled BLE RNodes. Host TX mpsc fills while FC drains slowly (overnight / busy TCP mesh). Skip RF sinks (`iface_is_rf_sink`: RNode name or bitrate under 100 kbps) in `broadcast_announce_on_interfaces` only. Local discovery announces still use `broadcast_local_announce_on_interfaces` (RNode included).

When ratspeak/rsReticulum rate-limits or excludes RF for announce rebroadcast equivalently on floated `origin/main` ([issue #24](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/issues/24)), remove this patch and the apply step.

## rsLXMF-propagation-client-abort-transfer.patch

Adds `PropagationClient::abort_transfer` so Cancel / mid-transfer abort leaves the client **Idle**. Without it, a cancelled Sync can leave `/get` stuck busy and the next Sync returns `PROPAGATION_RETRIEVE_BUSY` forever (or Auto falsely concludes there are no PNs).

Listed in `scripts/lib/ratspeak-overlay-apply-list.sh` and `RATSPEAK_PATCH_ENTRIES` in `scripts/update.sh`. Sidecar `PropagationBridge::cancel_client_download` must call `abort_transfer`.

### Sunset

When upstream rsLXMF exposes equivalent abort / cancel mid-transfer cleanup, remove this patch and the apply step.

## rsLXMF-propagation-client-lrproof-diagnostics.patch

Adds sticky `last_establish_error` on `PropagationClient` so client `/get` Sync surfaces `LrproofIdentityMissing`, `LrproofInvalid`, and `LrproofInvalidKey` instead of a generic `NoLinkProof` (parity with peer `/offer` via `rsLXMF-propagation-sync-peering.patch`).

Listed in `scripts/lib/ratspeak-overlay-apply-list.sh` and `RATSPEAK_PATCH_ENTRIES` in `scripts/update.sh`. Sidecar `PropagationBridge::poll_client_download` reads `client.last_establish_error()`.

### Sunset

When upstream rsLXMF exposes equivalent PropagationClient LRPROOF diagnostics, remove this patch and the apply step.

## rsReticulum-ble-rnode-flow-control-ready-timeout.patch

When BLE RNode `flow_control` is on, wait up to 2s for `CMD_READY`, then release the one-packet permit so NUS links that never deliver READY cannot freeze the host 256-slot TX queue after the first frame. Still paces bursts when READY works.

### Sunset

When upstream rsReticulum lands equivalent BLE READY timeout / non-blocking FC, remove this patch and the apply step.

## rsReticulum-response-resource-window-fast.patch

Promote inbound **response** Resources to `WINDOW_MAX_FAST` (75) when Link RTT is ≤ 1s. `grow()` only leaves `WINDOW_MAX_SLOW` (10) after four rounds above `RATE_FAST` (6250 B/s). A 2-hop TCP hub at ~200–300ms RTT stays around 8–20 KB/s, so a ~480 KB Nomad `/media` Resource crawls ~16–20s. Jumping the window matches the observed TCP-class path without changing RF slow-start.

| **Base commit** | `9bc7ee5` (`ratspeak/rsReticulum` `origin/main`) |

### Apply locally

./scripts/apply-rsReticulum-response-resource-window-fast.sh
```

Listed in `scripts/lib/ratspeak-overlay-apply-list.sh` and `RATSPEAK_PATCH_ENTRIES` in `scripts/update.sh`. Sidecar Nomad browse reuses one `LinkSession` per dest so this window applies to page + queued `/media` on the same Link.

### Sunset

When upstream rsReticulum promotes TCP-class response Resources (or otherwise reaches `WINDOW_MAX_FAST` without waiting on `RATE_FAST`), remove this patch and the apply step.

## Removed: rsLXMF-propagation-client-link-attached-tx.patch

Sunset when floated rsLXMF `origin/main` pinned PropagationClient link-scoped TX with `SendLinkEndpoint` plus `attached_interface` (interface-pinned link TX). That superseded the local `OutboundAttached` / `queue_link_outbound` overlay for the same pathless-Link flood as [ratspeak/rsReticulum#22](https://github.com/ratspeak/rsReticulum/issues/22). Tracked entry removed from `RATSPEAK_PATCH_ENTRIES` in `scripts/update.sh` after sunset confirmation.
